          {"id": 1, "question": "Core feature of a major depressive episode", "answer": "A major depressive episode is characterized by either depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities. Additional symptoms include significant weight changes, sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor changes, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, diminished concentration ability, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Symptoms must last at least two weeks and cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment."},
          {"id": 2, "question": "Core feature of a manic episode", "answer": "A manic episode involves abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood lasting at least one week (or any duration if hospitalization is required). Core symptoms include inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness or pressure of speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity, and excessive involvement in high-risk activities. The mood disturbance must be severe enough to cause marked impairment in functioning or necessitate hospitalization."},
          {"id": 3, "question": "Core feature of PTSD", "answer": "PTSD develops following exposure to a traumatic event involving actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. The disorder comprises four symptom clusters: intrusive symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares, distressing memories), avoidance (avoiding trauma-related thoughts, feelings, or stimuli), negative alterations in cognition and mood (negative beliefs, persistent blame, detachment, anhedonia), and alterations in arousal and reactivity (hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, recklessness). Symptoms persist for more than one month and cause significant distress or functional impairment."},
          {"id": 4, "question": "Definition of a delusion", "answer": "A delusion is a fixed false belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. Delusions are not merely opinions, cultural or religious beliefs, or ideas of reference. They persist despite clear contradictory evidence and are held with absolute conviction. Common types include paranoid (persecution), grandiose (special abilities or status), somatic (body-related false beliefs), and nihilistic delusions. Delusions are characteristic of psychotic disorders and cause significant distress or impact behavior."},
          {"id": 5, "question": "Definition of a hallucination", "answer": "A hallucination is a sensory perception that occurs without any external stimulus. It occurs in any sensory modality: visual (seeing), auditory (hearing), tactile (feeling), olfactory (smelling), or gustatory (tasting). Hallucinations are perceived as real by the individual experiencing them and are not under voluntary control. They differ from illusions (misperceptions of real stimuli) and occur in psychotic disorders, severe mood disorders, substance intoxication or withdrawal, medical conditions, and sleep disorders."},
          {"id": 6, "question": "Hallmark of panic disorder", "answer": "The hallmark of panic disorder is recurrent unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of persistent concern about having additional attacks or worry about the implications of the attacks. A panic attack involves a sudden surge of intense fear or discomfort with physical symptoms (palpitations, sweating, trembling, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, derealization/depersonalization, fear of losing control or dying) peaking within minutes. The attacks must cause significant distress or result in behavioral changes (avoidance of situations or activities)."},
          {"id": 7, "question": "Core feature of OCD", "answer": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder involves either obsessions (recurrent, intrusive thoughts, urges, or images recognized as unwanted) or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to prevent anxiety or reduce distress). Common obsessions include fears of contamination, harm, need for symmetry, and taboo thoughts. Common compulsions include washing, checking, ordering, and counting. The obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming (at least 1 hour daily), cause significant distress, and interfere with functioning or relationships despite recognition that they are excessive."},
          {"id": 8, "question": "Core feature of GAD", "answer": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry occurring on more days than not for at least six months about various aspects of daily life. The worry is difficult to control and associated with at least three symptoms: restlessness or feeling on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. The anxiety and worry cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."},
          {"id": 9, "question": "Core feature of schizophrenia", "answer": "Schizophrenia involves characteristic psychotic symptoms including two or more from: delusions, hallucinations (especially auditory), disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms (diminished emotional expression, avolition, alogia, anhedonia). The psychotic symptoms must be prominent for at least one month. Additionally, there must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months total, including the active phase plus possible prodromal or residual periods. The disorder causes significant functional or occupational impairment."},
          {"id": 10, "question": "Core feature of hypomania", "answer": "A hypomanic episode involves abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood lasting at least four consecutive days, observable by others. Symptoms include inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity, and excessive involvement in potentially risky activities. Unlike mania, hypomania does not cause marked impairment in functioning, does not require hospitalization, and the behavioral changes are not severe enough to cause obvious dysfunction in work, school, or social relationships."}

          {"id": 11, "question": "Symptoms began suddenly yesterday", "answer": "Acute onset refers to symptoms that appear suddenly with rapid development, typically within hours or a day. This distinguishes acute presentations from insidious or gradual-onset conditions. Acute onset is characteristic of panic attacks, acute stress reactions, brief psychotic episodes, and organic medical conditions like stroke or seizures. Acute presentations often require rapid evaluation to rule out medical emergencies and may indicate a sudden precipitant or stressor."},
          {"id": 12, "question": "Symptoms have been stable for 4 months", "answer": "A stable course indicates that symptoms have remained relatively unchanged in severity, frequency, and character over an extended period (in this case, four months). Stable courses suggest either: well-controlled chronic conditions with appropriate treatment, conditions that have plateaued at a particular level of severity, or potentially chronic conditions that maintain a steady state. Stability typically indicates that current treatment is effective or that the natural course of the disorder has reached equilibrium."},
          {"id": 13, "question": "Symptoms worsen every evening", "answer": "Diurnal variation refers to a predictable daily pattern where symptoms fluctuate based on time of day, with particular worsening in the evening. This pattern is commonly seen in mood disorders (depression often worse in morning, anxiety often worse in evening), delirium (sundowning), sleep disorders, and certain medical conditions. Evening worsening may relate to circadian rhythms, accumulated daily stress, fatigue, or changes in neurochemical levels throughout the day."},
          {"id": 14, "question": "Belief that coworkers are plotting against him", "answer": "A persecutory delusion is a fixed false belief that one is being harassed, threatened, plotted against, poisoned, spied on, or conspired against by others. These delusions involve a sense of being targeted or victimized by specific individuals or groups. Persecutory delusions are common in schizophrenia, delusional disorder (persecutory type), paranoid personality disorder, and mood disorders with psychotic features. They significantly impair social and occupational functioning and may lead to defensive or protective behaviors."},
          {"id": 15, "question": "Reports hearing footsteps when alone", "answer": "An auditory hallucination is a false perception of sound occurring without external auditory stimuli. Common forms include hearing voices (most frequent), footsteps, music, or other noises. Auditory hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination in psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. They can be perceived as threatening or benign, may command the patient to perform actions, and significantly impact functioning. They differ from tinnitus in that they are perceived as external rather than internal sounds."},
          {"id": 16, "question": "Speech is rapid and pressured", "answer": "Pressured speech is rapid, increased rate of speech that is often difficult to interrupt, with increased loudness and rapid delivery of ideas. It reflects the accelerated thinking and heightened psychomotor activity characteristic of elevated mood states. Pressured speech is associated with mania, hypomania, and ADHD. The speech may become difficult to follow as ideas jump rapidly from topic to topic (flight of ideas). Pressured speech reflects the internal experience of racing thoughts and urgency to communicate ideas."},
          {"id": 17, "question": "Shows minimal emotional expression", "answer": "Blunted affect refers to markedly diminished emotional expression, with restricted range and intensity of emotional responses. The individual's face, voice, and gestures show little emotional reactivity even to emotionally stimulating situations or topics. Blunted affect is a negative symptom characteristic of schizophrenia and can occur in severe depression, autism spectrum disorder, and medication side effects. It represents a restriction of the outward expression of emotion rather than absence of internal emotional experience."},
          {"id": 18, "question": "Symptoms cause major work impairment", "answer": "Severe symptom severity refers to symptoms causing marked functional impairment across multiple domains including work, school, social relationships, or self-care. Severe impairment means the individual has difficulty performing job responsibilities, maintaining employment, or meeting occupational demands. Assessment of severity considers whether symptoms cause failure to perform essential functions, require work modifications or accommodations, result in job loss or inability to work, or interfere with advancement and productivity. Severity is a key diagnostic criterion in many psychiatric disorders."},
          {"id": 19, "question": "Symptoms fluctuate weekly", "answer": "An episodic course refers to a pattern where symptoms wax and wane with regular or semi-regular cycles of exacerbation and improvement. Weekly fluctuations suggest a pattern with distinct episodes of symptom escalation followed by periods of relative improvement or remission. This is seen in bipolar disorder, cyclothymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and some anxiety disorders. Episodic patterns differ from chronic or progressive courses and may indicate underlying biological rhythms or cyclical disease processes."},
          {"id": 20, "question": "Symptoms gradually worsened over 6 months", "answer": "A progressive course indicates steadily worsening symptoms over an extended period without improvement or remission, with increasing severity, functional impact, and potential complications. Progressive deterioration typically suggests: inadequately treated conditions, degenerative processes (neurodegenerative disorders, dementia), unresolved underlying medical conditions, accumulating psychosocial stressors, or natural disease progression without intervention. Progressive courses require urgent clinical reassessment of diagnosis, treatment adequacy, and identification of modifiable factors."}

          {"id": 21, "question": "3 weeks depressed mood, anhedonia, severe impairment, no psychosis", "answer": "F32.2 - Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe without Psychotic Features. This diagnosis applies to a first major depressive episode lasting at least two weeks with depressed mood or anhedonia, significant functional impairment, at least five depressive symptoms (sleep disturbance, appetite changes, fatigue, guilt, concentration problems, psychomotor changes), but without psychotic features (delusions, hallucinations). The severity designation reflects significant reduction in work/social functioning and distress level."},
          {"id": 22, "question": "1 week elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, hospitalization", "answer": "F31.2 - Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic, Moderate Severity. This diagnosis requires abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood for at least one week with decreased need for sleep (not sleep loss due to insomnia), goal-directed activity increase, racing thoughts, and distractibility. Hospitalization is often required due to marked functional impairment or risk of harm. The manic symptoms represent a clear departure from baseline functioning and severity is sufficient to cause obvious impairment in occupational or social functioning."},
          {"id": 23, "question": "6 months excessive worry, restlessness, muscle tension", "answer": "F41.1 - Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This diagnosis requires persistent excessive anxiety and worry occurring on more days than not for at least six months. Associated symptoms include restlessness, easy fatigability, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. The worry extends across multiple life domains (work, family, finances, health) and is difficult to control. The anxiety causes clinically significant distress and functional impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of life."},
          {"id": 24, "question": "1 month auditory hallucinations, no mood symptoms", "answer": "F20.0 - Schizophrenia, Paranoid Type (or Paranoid Presentation). This diagnosis is based on presence of prominent auditory hallucinations (often voices) and/or paranoid delusions occurring for at least one month during active phase, with prodromal or residual symptoms for at least six months total duration. Paranoid presentation features preoccupation with delusions and hallucinations, relative preservation of cognitive functioning compared to other psychotic presentations, and significant functional impairment despite absence of primary mood disturbance."},
          {"id": 25, "question": "2 weeks intrusive trauma memories, avoidance, hyperarousal", "answer": "F43.1 - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Chronic. This diagnosis follows documented exposure to death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threatened sexual violence. The four required symptom clusters include: intrusive symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares), active avoidance of trauma reminders, negative mood/cognition changes (negative beliefs, blame, emotional numbing), and arousal alterations (hypervigilance, startle response, irritability). Symptoms persist for more than three months (chronic specification) and cause significant distress or functional impairment in work, social, or personal relationships."},
          {"id": 26, "question": "2 years low mood, low energy, mild symptoms", "answer": "F34.1 - Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). This diagnosis requires depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least two years (one year for children/adolescents). Symptoms are generally milder than major depression but more chronic, including low energy, low self-esteem, poor concentration, hopelessness, and sleep/appetite disturbance. Notably, the individual has not been free from symptoms for more than two months at a time during this period. Despite mild-to-moderate severity, the chronic nature significantly impacts personal, social, and occupational functioning."},
          {"id": 27, "question": "Recurrent depressive episodes without psychosis", "answer": "F33.1 - Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Episode, Moderate Severity. This diagnosis applies to individuals with history of two or more major depressive episodes separated by at least two months of remission. The current episode meets criteria for moderate severity without psychotic features. Recurrent depression typically has earlier onset age, increased duration of episodes, and greater functional impairment compared to single episodes. The pattern of recurrence indicates a chronic course and often requires longer-term maintenance treatment for symptom prevention and relapse prevention."},
          {"id": 28, "question": "Sudden onset confusion, fluctuating consciousness", "answer": "F05 - Delirium. This diagnosis requires disturbance of attention (reduced ability to focus/sustain/shift attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to environment) developing over a short period (hours to days), with tendency to fluctuate. Associated symptoms include cognitive disturbance (memory problems, disorientation, language disturbance), sleep-wake cycle disruption, emotional disturbance (fear, anxiety, irritability), and psychomotor changes (hyperactivity, hypoactivity, or mixed). Delirium is typically secondary to another medical condition, substance use, medication effect, or combination thereof, and requires urgent identification and treatment of underlying etiology."},
          {"id": 29, "question": "Persistent social anxiety in social situations", "answer": "F40.1 - Social Anxiety Disorder. This diagnosis requires marked fear or anxiety triggered specifically by social situations where individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others (performance, eating, speaking, or meeting strangers). The individual fears being embarrassed, negatively evaluated, or judged by others and experiences anxiety that is out of proportion to actual danger posed. Social situations are avoided or endured with intense distress lasting at least six months. The fear and avoidance cause clinically significant impairment in occupational, social, or other important areas of functioning."},
          {"id": 30, "question": "Recurrent panic attacks with persistent worry", "answer": "F41.0 - Panic Disorder. This diagnosis requires recurrent unexpected panic attacks (sudden surge of fear/discomfort with physical symptoms like palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, fear of losing control or dying) followed by at least one month of persistent concern about additional attacks or worry about implications. The individual may change behavior to avoid situations or activities believed to trigger attacks. Panic attacks typically peak within minutes and cause significant distress or functional impairment despite recognition that fear is disproportionate to actual danger posed."}

          {"id": 31, "question": "Episodic elevated mood and decreased need for sleep", "answer": "Bipolar I or II Disorder - episodic elevated mood for days to weeks with markedly decreased need for sleep but continued high energy is characteristic of manic or hypomanic episodes. Distinguishing features: Cyclothymia - similar pattern but milder amplitude, shorter duration (3+ days), persistent for 2+ years with no periods of normal mood lasting more than 2 months. GAD and hyperthyroidism show anxiety rather than true elevated/expansive mood. Bipolar requires family history screening and assessment of functioning impairment."},
          {"id": 32, "question": "Chronic worry and muscle tension", "answer": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder - excessive worry for 6+ months with muscle tension and at least 2 other anxiety symptoms. Hyperthyroidism and other medical conditions (caffeine toxicity, stimulant intoxication) must be ruled out with TSH, free T4, and toxicology screening. Sleep disorders, caffeine use, anxiety disorders, and PTSD can present with similar tension. Key distinction: GAD worry is about future events and persistent; medical causes improve with treatment of underlying condition."},
          {"id": 33, "question": "Auditory hallucinations without mood symptoms", "answer": "Schizophrenia - first-rank auditory hallucinations (hearing voices commenting or conversing) in absence of mood symptoms for 1+ month indicate primary psychotic disorder. Schizoaffective Disorder - similar psychotic symptoms concurrent with major mood episode (depression or mania) lasting weeks or longer. Other differential: Brief Psychotic Disorder (symptoms <1 month), Substance-Induced Psychosis, Medical Psychosis (encephalitis, delirium), and Psychotic Disorder NOS."},
          {"id": 34, "question": "Acute confusion and visual hallucinations", "answer": "Delirium - acute onset (hours to days), fluctuating consciousness, confusion, visual hallucinations, due to medical condition, medication, infection, hypoxia, metabolic disturbance, or withdrawal. Substance Intoxication or Withdrawal - acute confusion with visual hallucinations from alcohol, stimulants, hallucinogens, or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Brief Psychotic Disorder vs. Schizophrenia: typically lack the acute medical symptoms and fluctuation. Requires urgent medical evaluation, labs, imaging to identify life-threatening cause."},
          {"id": 35, "question": "Social withdrawal and flat affect", "answer": "Schizophrenia - negative symptoms (social withdrawal, anhedonia, blunted/flat affect, alogia, avolition) as primary features over time. Severe Major Depressive Episode - depressed mood, withdrawal, flat affect due to depression; psychomotor retardation and anhedonia present; negative symptoms improve as mood improves. Autism Spectrum Disorder - lifelong pattern of social difficulty, not acute onset. Medication side effects (antipsychotics) can cause flat affect. Distinguishing: schizophrenia shows positive symptoms initially; depression shows depressed mood as primary complaint."},
          {"id": 36, "question": "Intrusive thoughts and repetitive checking", "answer": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - intrusive obsessive thoughts (contamination fears, harm fears) with compulsive checking behaviors to reduce anxiety; time-consuming (1+ hour daily), significantly distressing. Generalized Anxiety Disorder - excessive worry with safety behaviors, but not true obsessions/compulsions; worry is about realistic concerns rather than irrational obsessions. Body Dysmorphic Disorder - repetitive checking of appearance. OCD distinguished by ego-dystonic (unwanted) obsessions and ritualistic compulsions, whereas GAD worries are more ego-syntonic."},
          {"id": 37, "question": "Sudden fear with palpitations", "answer": "Panic Disorder - sudden surge of intense fear with physical symptoms (palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness) peaking within minutes, recurrent attacks with persistent worry. Hyperthyroidism - anxiety, palpitations, tremor, tachycardia, heat intolerance; thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) differentiate. Cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac disease - chest pain and palpitations; requires EKG. Acute Stress Disorder or Phobias - fear response to specific trigger. Distinguishing: Panic attacks lack clear trigger; medical causes have consistent vital sign abnormalities."},
          {"id": 38, "question": "Persistent low mood for 2 years", "answer": "Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) - 2+ years of depressed mood on more days than not with chronic low-grade depressive symptoms (2+ of: fatigue, concentration difficulty, appetite change, sleep change, low self-esteem, hopelessness). Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder - multiple episodes of major depression separated by periods of normal mood, total duration 2+ years due to recurrence. Chronic Medical Illness - medical conditions (hypothyroidism, autoimmune disease, chronic pain) can cause chronic low mood; medical workup essential."},
          {"id": 39, "question": "Elevated mood lasting 3 days", "answer": "Hypomania (Bipolar II Disorder) - abnormally elevated mood for 3-4 days (meets 4-day minimum for hypomanic episode) with goal-directed activity and decreased need for sleep; no marked functional impairment or hospitalization. Cyclothymia - persistent pattern of mild mood elevation (3+ days) alternating with mild depression lasting 2+ years; multiple episodes of hypomanic-like and depressive-like symptoms. Brief elevated mood <3 days not meeting diagnostic criteria. Distinguishing: Hypomania indicates Bipolar II; Cyclothymia milder and more chronic."},
          {"id": 40, "question": "Memory impairment and disorientation", "answer": "Dementia - progressive cognitive decline including memory loss, disorientation, apraxia, agnosia over months to years with clear sensorium. Delirium - acute confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, fluctuating consciousness with inattention due to medical condition, medication, or metabolic disturbance; reversible if underlying cause treated. Severe depression - pseudodementia with concentration difficulty and memory problems from cognitive impairment rather than neurodegeneration. Distinguishing: Dementia gradual onset and progressive; delirium acute and fluctuating; mood disorder shows depressed mood and improves with antidepressants."}

Sertraline is a first-line antidepressant used for major depression, anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD. It selectively inhibits serotonin reuptake, increasing synaptic serotonin. Common side effects include sexual dysfunction, GI disturbance, and activation. Typical starting dose is 50-100mg daily with therapeutic effects observed in 2-4 weeks."},
          {"id": 42, "question": "Lithium belongs to which class", "answer": "Mood Stabilizer/Antimania agent. Lithium is a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly effective for acute mania and maintenance treatment. It has narrow therapeutic window (0.6-1.2 mEq/L), requiring regular serum level monitoring. Side effects include tremor, polyuria, polydipsia, and weight gain. Lithium has neuroprotective properties and reduces suicide risk in bipolar disorder and depression."},
          {"id": 43, "question": "Risperidone belongs to which class", "answer": "Atypical (Second-Generation) Antipsychotic. Risperidone is used for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and behavioral disturbances. It blocks dopamine D2 receptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Common side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms (though less than typical antipsychotics), hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, and metabolic effects. Available as oral tablet or long-acting injection for improved compliance."},
          {"id": 44, "question": "Haloperidol belongs to which class", "answer": "Typical (First-Generation) Antipsychotic. Haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic used for acute psychosis and agitation, particularly in emergency settings due to rapid onset. It primarily blocks dopamine D2 receptors. Major side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms (akathisia, dystonia, Parkinsonism), tardive dyskinesia (long-term), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation. Less commonly used now due to atypical antipsychotic availability."},
          {"id": 45, "question": "Clozapine carries risk of what serious side effect", "answer": "Agranulocytosis - a potentially life-threatening decrease in white blood cells with risk of severe infection. Clozapine requires mandatory baseline and regular (weekly initially, then monthly) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) monitoring. Risk is highest in first 3 months of treatment. Other serious side effects include myocarditis, seizures, orthostatic hypotension, and metabolic syndrome. Despite risks, clozapine is most effective antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia."},
          {"id": 46, "question": "Olanzapine is associated with what risk", "answer": "Metabolic Syndrome - including weight gain, hyperglycemia/diabetes risk, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Olanzapine has among the highest metabolic side effect risks of atypical antipsychotics. Patients require baseline and ongoing monitoring of weight, fasting glucose, lipid panel, and blood pressure. Despite metabolic risks, olanzapine is highly effective for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Lifestyle modifications and possible additional medications may be needed to mitigate metabolic effects."},
          {"id": 47, "question": "Fluoxetine belongs to which class", "answer": "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). Fluoxetine is a first-line antidepressant with FDA approval for depression, OCD, panic disorder, bulimia, and PMDD. It has long half-life (4-6 days) allowing weekly dosing for treatment maintenance. Side effects include sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal effects, activation, and potential serotonin syndrome. Fluoxetine requires 2-4 weeks to show therapeutic benefit, with full effect at 6-8 weeks."},
          {"id": 48, "question": "Valproate belongs to which class", "answer": "Mood Stabilizer (Anticonvulsant). Valproic acid/divalproex is FDA-approved for acute mania and bipolar maintenance. It is effective in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder and mixed episodes. Mechanism involves increasing GABA and modifying protein kinase C. Side effects include tremor, weight gain, alopecia, hepatotoxicity (rare but serious), and teratogenicity. Requires baseline liver function tests and periodic monitoring. Therapeutic levels are 50-100 mcg/mL."},
          {"id": 49, "question": "Lorazepam belongs to which class", "answer": "Benzodiazepine (short-acting anxiolytic). Lorazepam is used for acute anxiety, agitation, insomnia, alcohol withdrawal, and as adjunctive treatment in psychotic disorders. It works by enhancing GABA inhibition in the CNS. Side effects include sedation, dependence/withdrawal risk, cognitive impairment, and tolerance with prolonged use. Lorazepam has intermediate duration with peak effects in 1-3 hours. Should be used short-term due to addiction and dependence potential."},
          {"id": 50, "question": "Quetiapine belongs to which class", "answer": "Atypical (Second-Generation) Antipsychotic. Quetiapine is used for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, bipolar depression, and major depression augmentation. It blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors. Side effects include sedation, weight gain, hyperglycemia risk, orthostatic hypotension, and cataracts (rare). Quetiapine has relatively weak D2 receptor binding compared to other antipsychotics. It is increasingly used off-label for insomnia due to sedating properties despite limited evidence."}

          {"id": 51, "question": "Symptoms gradually improve over 3 months", "answer": "Improving/Remitting course - indicates positive response to treatment or natural recovery over 3 months. Gradual improvement suggests steady-state treatment efficacy. In depression, meaningful improvement typically appears by 4-6 weeks; 3-month improvement indicates sustained response. This trajectory suggests favorable prognosis with appropriate ongoing treatment and monitoring. May represent response to antidepressant, psychotherapy, or environmental improvements."},
          {"id": 52, "question": "Symptoms worsen after medication discontinuation", "answer": "Relapse - recurrence of symptoms following cessation of effective treatment, indicating dependence on medication for symptom control. Relapse rate varies by disorder but is high for schizophrenia (70-80% at 1 year without maintenance), bipolar disorder, and recurrent depression. Demonstrates need for long-term maintenance treatment. Relapse differs from recurrence, which refers to new episodes after full remission."},
          {"id": 53, "question": "Symptoms fluctuate weekly", "answer": "Episodic course - pattern of recurring episodes or exacerbations separated by periods of relative stability or remission. Weekly fluctuations suggest cycling pattern, possibly related to circadian/ultradian rhythms, weekly stressors, or underlying biological cycles. Episodic patterns are characteristic of bipolar disorder, cyclothymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and some anxiety disorders. Episodic courses differ from chronic steady-state courses."},
          {"id": 54, "question": "Symptoms remain unchanged for 6 months", "answer": "Stable/Plateau course - maintenance of consistent symptom severity without significant worsening or improvement over 6-month period. Stability indicates: adequate treatment effect with current regimen, chronic condition that has reached equilibrium, or natural plateau in disease progression. Stable courses may be favorable (well-controlled symptoms) or concerning (residual untreated symptoms). Requires monitoring for future deterioration or opportunities for improvement."},
          {"id": 55, "question": "Symptoms worsen steadily over 1 year", "answer": "Progressive/Deteriorating course - continuous worsening of symptoms over 1-year period with accumulating severity and functional decline. Progressive courses suggest: inadequate or ineffective current treatment, unidentified medical or psychiatric comorbidities, non-adherence to treatment, accumulating psychosocial stressors, or underlying disease progression (as in neurodegenerative disorders). Requires urgent reassessment of diagnosis, treatment adequacy, and investigation of new factors."},
          {"id": 56, "question": "Symptoms improve briefly then worsen again", "answer": "Partial remission or intermittent response - initial treatment response with symptom improvement followed by recurrence or relapse. May indicate: inadequate medication dosage, poor medication compliance, recurrent environmental stressors triggering symptom return, or incomplete treatment response. Partial remission differs from full remission (complete symptom resolution). Suggests need for treatment intensification, combination therapy, or psychotherapy augmentation."},
          {"id": 57, "question": "Symptoms return after 6 months of remission", "answer": "Recurrence - development of new episode of psychiatric illness after a period of full remission (6+ months symptom-free). Recurrence indicates vulnerability to future episodes and need for maintenance/preventive treatment. Different from relapse (symptom return shortly after treatment discontinuation). Recurrence rate varies: 50% of first depressive episodes recur; bipolar disorder has high recurrence (70% within 5 years). Recurrence necessitates long-term treatment planning."},
          {"id": 58, "question": "Symptoms improve with stress reduction", "answer": "Stress-responsive course - symptom exacerbation related to psychosocial stressors with improvement during periods of stress reduction or environmental change. Indicates anxiety disorders, adjustment disorders, and stress-related conditions showing clear relationship between stressor exposure and symptom severity. Stress-responsiveness suggests importance of psychotherapy, stress management, environmental modification, and support. May indicate better prognosis with effective coping and life changes."},
