Common forms include hearing voices (most frequent), footsteps, music, or other noises. Auditory hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination in psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. They can be perceived as threatening or benign, may command the patient to perform actions, and significantly impact functioning. They differ from tinnitus in that they are perceived as external rather than internal sounds.",

          "ground_truth_answer": "Benzodiazepine (short-acting anxiolytic). Lorazepam is used for acute anxiety, agitation, insomnia, alcohol withdrawal, and as adjunctive treatment in psychotic disorders. It works by enhancing GABA inhibition in the CNS. Side effects include sedation, dependence/withdrawal risk, cognitive impairment, and tolerance with prolonged use. Lorazepam has intermediate duration with peak effects in 1-3 hours. Should be used short-term due to addiction and dependence potential.",

It blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors. Side effects include sedation, weight gain, hyperglycemia risk, orthostatic hypotension, and cataracts (rare). Quetiapine has relatively weak D2 receptor binding compared to other antipsychotics. It is increasingly used off-label for insomnia due to sedating properties despite limited evidence.",
