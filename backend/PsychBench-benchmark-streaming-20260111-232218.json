        "question": "Core feature of a major depressive episode",
        "ground_truth": "A major depressive episode is characterized by either depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities. Additional symptoms include significant weight changes, sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor changes, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, diminished concentration ability, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Symptoms must last at least two weeks and cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment.",
        "mistral_response": "A major depressive episode, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), is a mental health disorder characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in activities, accompanied by several other symptoms. These core features include:\n\n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note: In children and adolescents, may be irritable mood.\n\n2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observations made by others).\n\n3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gains.\n\n4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.\n\n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely feeling restless or slowed down).\n\n6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n\n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).\n\n8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).\n\n9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.\n\nFor the diagnosis of a major depressive episode, these symptoms must be present for at least two weeks and represent a change from previous functioning. Additionally, they must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.",

        "ground_truth": "A manic episode involves abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood lasting at least one week (or any duration if hospitalization is required). Core symptoms include inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness or pressure of speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity, and excessive involvement in high-risk activities. The mood disturbance must be severe enough to cause marked impairment in functioning or necessitate hospitalization.",
        "mistral_response": "A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood, associated with increased energy, activity, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that can lead to unpleasant outcomes. The core features of a manic episode, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), include:\n\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity: An exaggerated sense of self-importance, belief in special powers or influence, or holdings delusional beliefs of greatness.\n2. Decreased need for sleep: A reduction in the amount of sleep required, often with little fatigue during the day.\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking\n4. Flight of ideas or racing thoughts: Rapid and jumbled thinking, frequently shifting from one idea to another without pausing to reflect on their connection.\n5. Distractibility: Difficulty focusing on a single task due to easily being sidetracked by extraneous stimuli.\n6. Increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation: Engaging in high levels of activity, such as excessive work, socializing, or physical endeavors, and demonstrating restlessness or agitation when idle.\n7. Excessive involvement in activities with a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., spending sprees, reckless sexual indiscretions, impulsive business investments)\n8. Inappropriate behavior: Acting out socially unacceptable behaviors without concern for the consequences\n9. Being easily distracted or unable to concentrate on one thing\n10. Unusual or extravagant ideas, feelings, or behaviors that deviate markedly from the individual's usual way of thinking or behaving.\n\nThese symptoms must persist for at least one week to meet criteria for a manic episode and cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. In some cases, these symptoms may be accompanied by hallucinations or delusions. A manic episode can occur as part of Bipolar I Disorder or Schizoaffective Disorder, among other conditions. If you suspect that someone is experiencing a manic episode, encourage them to seek help from a mental health professional.",

Common themes of obsessions include contamination, aggressive thoughts, sexuality, and symmetry/order.\n\n2. **Compulsions**: These are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.

Symptoms of panic attacks include sudden episodes of intense fear, heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and feelings of unreality. Persistent worry often characterizes anxiety disorders and can involve excessive, uncontrollable, and intrusive thoughts about everyday situations.\n\nIf you suspect that you have an anxiety disorder, it is essential to seek help from a mental health professional who can provide you with a proper diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your needs.

This could be due to various reasons such as changes in temperature, humidity, or daylight hours. Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. Dress warmly: Cold weather can exacerbate certain symptoms. Wearing layers and keeping warm can help manage discomfort.\n\n2. Humidifier: Dry air can worsen respiratory issues. Using a humidifier in your home can help alleviate dryness in the air, making it easier to breathe.\n\n3. Sunlight exposure: Lack of sunlight during winter months can lead to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons. Spending time near windows with natural light or using a light therapy box can help improve mood and energy levels.\n\n4. Regular exercise: Exercise is beneficial year-round, but it can be particularly helpful during the winter months as it increases blood circulation, boosts your mood, and can help manage symptoms.\n\n5. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of fluids can help combat dry skin and reduce the risk of respiratory infections.\n\n6. Consult a healthcare professional: If your symptoms persist or worsen despite trying these measures, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider who can provide personalized advice and treatment options.",
