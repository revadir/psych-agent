Additional symptoms include significant weight changes, sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor changes, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, diminished concentration ability, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation.

They are often associated with certain medical conditions, such as mental health disorders like schizophrenia, or as side effects of substance use or withdrawal, brain injuries, or certain medications.
